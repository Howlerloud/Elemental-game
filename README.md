  <ol>As a first time user I want to see how to beat the game.<br>On the front page of the game a clearn image shows what each element counters and what they get countered by.</ol>
  <ol>As a first time user I want to know when I have won or lost the game.<br>After beating all 6 enemys the game comes up with a display showing I have beaten the dungeon. If I am defeated the game notifies me that I have been overrun.</ol>

<h2>Wireframes</h2>
<p>Below are the wireframes created for this project to give a good guide on how the finished product will look</p>

<p>The gameboard shows a list of 6 elemental monsters that the user has control over and must use them to defeat the monsters in the dungeon</p>

<p>When a monster card is clicked it will either end the game telling the user they have been defeated if they picked incorrectly or flip and not be usable again if the user is correct.</p>
