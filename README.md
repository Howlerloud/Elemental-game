<h1>Project Goals and User Experience</h1>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The objective of this project is to make a fun facepaced card game that keeps the user thinking on the spot trying to memorise a list of elements and their strenghts and weaknesses.</li>
  <li>It has been designed to be easy to interact with with 3 modes of difficulty.</li>
</ul>
<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ol>
  <li>As a first time user I want a clear and easy way to start the game.<br>The game shows a start button on the front of the page followed by a choice of 3 difficulty buttons</li>
  <li>As a first time user I want to see how to beat the game.<br>On the front page of the game a clear image shows what each element counters and what they get countered by and a instructions popup.</li>
  <li>As a first time user I want to know when I have won or lost the game.<br>After beating all 6 enemys the game comes up with a display showing I have beaten the dungeon. If I am defeated the game notifies me that I have been overrun.</li>
  <li>As a user I want the game to vary with difficulty giving me a reason to come back and improve. I can clearly see when I start the game there is 3 difficultys to choose from that decrease the timer and increase the monster interval speed.</li>
  <li>As a user I want to be able to keep track of my wins. There is a win counter displayed at the top of the screen for me to keep track of my win streak.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Adding Light and Dark elements to the game on hard mode</li>
  <li>On easy mode give the user 2 lives with each element so they dont lose on first pick</li>
  <li>A win streak counter to track the users wins and add secret level after 10 winsd</li>
</ul>
